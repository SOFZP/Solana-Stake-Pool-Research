# ðŸ”¥ Solana Stake Pool Research (12-June-2025)

This repository provides a structured and technical overview of major Solana stake pools as of June 2025.  
The document is intended for validator operators, contributors, and tooling developers who want to understand delegation criteria, performance benchmarks, and integration points with each pool.

> ðŸ§ª Future updates will include eligibility-checking scripts using public APIs and validator performance scoring tools.

## ðŸ“˜ Notes

- **Recommended Commission** refers to the typical commission level expected by the pool to qualify for delegation.  
  It is not always a hard requirement but rather reflects what is practically needed to receive stake.
- All data was collected manually and cross-verified where possible. If a detail is out of date, contributions are welcome!
